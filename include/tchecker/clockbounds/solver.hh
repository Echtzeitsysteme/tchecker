 \brief Clock bounds solver for diagonal free timed automata
 \note This solver is based on two papers "Static guards analysis in timed automata verification", Behrmann,
 Bouyer, Fleury and Larsen, TACAS 2003 and "Forward analysis of updatable timed automata", Bouyer, FMSD 2004.

 We allow guards of the form x # c for clock x, integer c and # any of <, <=, ==, >= and >. We allow statements
 of the form x:=c, x:=y and x:=y+c for clocks x and y, and integer c.

 We associate to every location l and every clock x two variables L_{l,x} and U_{l,x} for the maximum lower bound
 on x in l, and the maximum upper bound on x in l respectively.

 Then to every transition l1 - g;s -> l2 in the automaton we associate the Diophantine equations:
 . L_{x,l1} >= c              if x > c / x >= c / x == c appears in g
 . U_{x,l1} >= c              if x < c / x <= c / x == c appears in g
 . L_{x,l1} >= L_{y,l2} - c   if y := x + c appears in s
 . U_{x,l1} >= U_{x,l2} - c   ...
 . L_{x,l1} >= L_{x,l2}       if x is not assigned to in s
 . U_{x,l1} >= U_{x,l2}       ...

 . L_{x,l1} >= L_{y,n} - c   if y := x + c appears in s and n is any location of any process that share y
 . U_{x,l1} >= U_{y,n} - c   if y := x + c appears in s and n is any location of any process that share y

 We take the conjunction of all the constraints for every transition in the automaton. The resulting system of
 Diophantine inequations is solved by computing the minimal path from L_{x,l} and U_{x,l} to 0 for every clock x
 and every location l, in the graph of the system of inequations.

 This class provides methods to specify the constraints from the transitions of an automaton, and a method to
 solve the system of inequations, and compute the resulting bounds.
